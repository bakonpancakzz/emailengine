# 📧 `emailengine`
A lightweight framework for sending and receiving emails, providing an API for 
automation and applications.

### Implement features like...
- 📨 Send emails from your applications via a REST API
- 🚫 Write a middleware to scan for and reject spam
- ✍ Collect and store emails in a Database

### Sound interesting?
Get started by reviewing a few [examples](examples) to see how to use the framework.  
Then dive into the [REST API](API.md) documentation to implement a client.

Need an in-depth tutorial? I’ve written a [guide](https://blog.panca.kz/setting-up-an-email-server)
that walks through everything — from registering a domain to receiving your first email.
